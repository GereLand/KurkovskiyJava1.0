Chapter 1. The boy who survived
Mr. and Mrs. Dursley lived in house number four on Tisova Street and always proudly declared that they,
thank god absolutely normal people. Already from someone, but they could not be expected from them into
some strange or mysterious situation. Mr. and Mrs. Dursley were very disapproving of any oddities,
riddles and other nonsense.
